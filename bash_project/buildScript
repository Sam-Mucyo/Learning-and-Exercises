                      Build a Build Script

One common use of bash scripts is for releasing a “build” of your source code. 
Sometimes your private source code may contain developer resources or private 
information that you don’t want to release in the published version.

In this project, you’ll create a release script to copy certain files from a s
ource directory into a build directory.

Description

<< Environment
Take a look at the build and source folders. The objective of our script is to
copy files from source to build, with a couple of exceptions and modifications.

      $ ls
      build  firstline  script.sh  source

      $ ls source
      bar.js        foo1.html  secretinfo.md
      buzz.css      foo2.html
      changelog.md  foo3.html

      $ ls build
